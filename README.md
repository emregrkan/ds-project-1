# CSE2225 Project #1

Task was to multiply two infinitely long natural numbers represented as any data structure. For this project I choose to represent them as _Doubly Linked List_. Could I do better than this ? Probably. But it compiles and it runs. Most important part for me is that it's original.

Anyways, I love C.
